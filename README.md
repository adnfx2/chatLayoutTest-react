This sample project was made to demonstrate some basic setup of redux in conjunction with react-redux. No middlewares were used for this project. 

I might upgrade this project in a different repository soon...

### `npm install or yarn install`
### `npm start or yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
